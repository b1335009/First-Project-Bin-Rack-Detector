# MML-Bin-Rack-Detector
🤖 From Zero to AI Vision: Built a Bin/Rack Detector with No Coding!

Just wrapped up my first AI project—and I’m hooked! 🚀 
1️⃣ Used @TeachableMachine to train an AI model to detect warehouse bins/racks. 
2️⃣ Wrote Python code (with help from @OpenAI’s ChatGPT) to log results to SQL.
3️⃣ Created a dashboard to track detection accuracy.

Biggest takeaway? You don’t need to be a coding expert to start with AI! #AI #ComputerVision #DataScience #NoCode

How I Detected Bins/Racks and Logged Data Like a Pro (With Zero Coding Experience!)

- Tools I Used
Google Images: Free photos of warehouse bins/racks.

Teachable Machine (by Google): Train AI models without code.

Google Colab: Free coding platform (no installs).

SQLite: Simple database built into Python.

-Step 1: Gather Training Images
Goal: Collect 10–20 images of “bins” and “racks” for the AI to learn.

-Step 2: Train the AI Model:
Tool: Teachable Machine (free, no signup).
Go to Teachable Machine → Click “Image Project”.
Create Classes:
Class 1: “Bin” → Upload your bin images.
Class 2: “Rack” → Upload your rack images.
Train the Model: Click “Train Model” → Wait 5–10 mins.
Export:
Click “Export Model” → Choose “TensorFlow Lite” → Download the ZIP file.

-Step 3: Set Up Python Code
Tool: Google Colab (free, browser-based).

-Step 4: Write the Code

-step 5: Test!
