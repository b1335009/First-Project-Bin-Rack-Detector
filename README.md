# MML-Bin-Rack-Detector
🤖 From Zero to AI Vision: Built a Bin/Rack Detector with No Coding!

Just wrapped up my first AI project—and I’m hooked! 🚀 
1️⃣ Used @TeachableMachine to train an AI model to detect warehouse bins/racks. 
2️⃣ Wrote Python code (with help from @OpenAI’s ChatGPT) to log results to SQL.
3️⃣ Created a dashboard to track detection accuracy.


Biggest takeaway? You don’t need to be a coding expert to start with AI! #AI #ComputerVision #DataScience #NoCode
